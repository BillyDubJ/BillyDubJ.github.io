		<p class="section">Use in Chinese medicine</p>

			<p>Seahorse populations are thought to be endangered as a result of overfishing and habitat destruction. Despite a lack of scientific studies or clinical trials, the consumption of seahorses is widespread in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily in connection with impotence, wheezing, nocturnal enuresis, and pain, as well as labor induction. Up to 20 million seahorses may be caught each year to be sold for such uses. Preferred species of seahorses include <i class="species">H. kellogii</i>, <i class="species">H. histrix</i>, <i class="species">H. kuda</i>, <i class="species">H. trimaculatus</i>, and <i class="species">H. mohnikei</i>. Seahorses are also consumed by Indonesians, central Filipinos, and many other ethnic groups.</p>

			<p>Import and export of seahorses has been controlled under <a href="" Class="externallink">CITES</a> since 15 May 2004. However, Indonesia, Japan, Norway, and South Korea have chosen to opt out of the trade rules set by CITES.</p>

			<p>The problem may be exacerbated by the growth of pills and capsules as the preferred method of ingesting seahorses. Pills are cheaper and more available than traditional, individually tailored prescriptions of whole seahorses, but the contents are harder to track. Seahorses once had to be of a certain size and quality before they were accepted by TCM practitioners and consumers. Declining availability of the preferred large, pale, and smooth seahorses has been offset by the shift towards prepackaged preparations, which makes it possible for TCM merchants to sell previously unused, or otherwise undesirable juvenile, spiny, and dark-coloured animals. Today, almost a third of the seahorses sold in China are packaged, adding to the pressure on the species. Dried seahorse retails from US&#36;600 to &#36;3000 per kilogram, with larger, paler, and smoother animals commanding the highest prices. In terms of value based on weight, seahorses retail for more than the price of silver and almost that of gold in Asia.</p>
