			<p>While many aquarium hobbyists keep them as pets, seahorses collected from the wild tend to fare poorly in home aquaria. Many eat only live foods such as brine shrimp and are prone to stress, which damages their immune systems and makes them susceptible to disease.[citation needed]</p>

			<p>In recent years, however, captive breeding has become more popular. Such seahorses survive better in captivity, and are less likely to carry diseases. They eat frozen mysidacea (crustaceans) that are readily available from aquarium stores, and do not experience the stress of moving out of the wild. Although captive-bred seahorses are more expensive, they take no toll on wild populations.</p>

			<p>Seahorses should be kept in an aquarium with low flow and placid tank mates. They are slow feeders, so fast, aggressive feeders will leave them without food. Seahorses can coexist with many species of shrimp and other bottom-feeding creatures. Gobies also make good tank-mates. Keepers are generally advised to avoid eels, tangs, triggerfish, squid, octopus, and sea anemones.</p>

			<p>Water quality is very important for the survival of seahorses in an aquarium. They are delicate species which should not be added to a new tank. The water parameters are recommended to be as follows although these fish may acclimatise to different water over time:</p>

				<p>Temperature: 23–28 &#8451; (73–82 &#8457;)</p>
				
				<p>pH: 8.1–8.4</p>
				
				<p>Ammonia: 0 <abbr aria-label="milligram per liter">mg/L</abbr> (0 ppm) (0.01 <abbr aria-label="milligram per liter">mg/L</abbr> (0.01 <abbr aria-label="Parts Per Milliliter">ppm</abbr>) may be tolerated for short periods)</p>
				
				<p>Nitrite: 0 mg/L (0 ppm) (0.125 <abbr aria-label="milligram per liter">mg/L</abbr> (0.125 <abbr aria-label="Parts Per Milliliter">ppm</abbr>) may be tolerated for short periods)</p>
				
				<p><abbr aria-label="Specific Gravity">S.G.</abbr>: 1.021–1.024 at 23–24 &#8451; (73–75 &#8457;)[citation needed]</p>
			
			<p>A water-quality problem will affect fish behaviour and can be shown by clamped fins, reduced feeding, erratic swimming, and gasping at the surface. Seahorses swim up and down, as well as using the length of the aquarium. Therefore, the tanks should ideally be twice as deep as the length of the adult seahorse.[citation needed]</p>
			
			<p>Animals sold as "freshwater seahorses" are usually the closely related pipefish, of which a few species live in the lower reaches of rivers. The supposed true "freshwater seahorse" called <i class="species">H. aimei</i> is not a valid species, but a synonym sometimes used for <i class="species">Barbour's</i> and hedgehog seahorses. The latter, which is often confused with the former, can be found in estuarine environments, but is not actually a freshwater fish.</p>
